## Getting Started

Gamoury or Game Armoury is a game collection database. Which utilizes an ever growing collectin of games for the user to add or remove from their inventory. This allows gamers to keep track of what games they are playing and which ones have completed.

## Next Steps

1. Would like to implement a section to view how many users have completed a game. 

2. Would like to implement creating games to devs and not users.

3. Would like to add a view of how many games in their inventory are completed. e.g "Games Completed: 3 of 10"
